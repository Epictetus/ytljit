1. What is ytljit?

 Ytljit is a native code generator for compiler.
You can generate native code using methods whose name is X86 nimonic.
Why I deverop ytljit instead of using llvm? Because according to 
my yarv2llvm's experience I think llvm don't have enough power 
for  Ruby compiler. I need rewriting native code and operation to raw stack 
and refer to CPU flags (carry,zero,negative and so on). 

2. Install

GEM or install script doesn't exist yet.
compile extend library writting in C (ext/*). 
copy extend library and  main program writting in Ruby (lib/*) to
your ruby library directory.

3. License
